Create an index.html page that serves as a game launcher for my web-based games. 

DESIGN CONCEPT:
- Outer frame: Classic Macintosh computer aesthetic (beige/cream colored monitor with chunky bezels, subtle scan lines)
- Inner content: Super Mario-inspired menu screen with vibrant colors, pixel art style elements
- Overall vibe: Playful nostalgia, 80s-90s gaming meets vintage computing

LAYOUT & FEATURES:
- The page should display a retro CRT monitor frame (Macintosh SE/Classic style)
- Inside the "screen": A Mario-style level select or world map aesthetic
- Game links styled as colorful blocks, coins, or question mark boxes
- Hover effects: gentle bouncing, glowing, or pixel shimmer
- Retro pixel fonts (like Press Start 2P from Google Fonts)
- Background: Consider a pixelated sky with clouds or a subtle grid pattern
- Optional: Animated sprites or elements (jumping mushroom, floating coins)

TECHNICAL:
- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks needed)
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive so it works on different screen sizes
- Each game link should be clearly clickable with good hover states

COLOR PALETTE:
- Macintosh beige (#F2F0E6) for outer frame
- Bright Mario colors inside: sky blue (#5C94FC), bright red (#E52521), gold (#FBD000), green (#00A800)

Make it delightful and fun - something that makes people smile when they see it!
